# Matchmaking

## Background

Currently, in both the `dev` branch and `main` branch, we have an integrated data ingestion functionality. This functionality collects various user information and stores it within the user model. See: `dataCollected Json?` in `schema.prisma` and `src/schemas/userSchema.ts` (`userDataCollectedSchema`). This data is processed and converted into embeddings using an AWS model. More details can be found in `src/lib/data/processors/processUserFirstPartyData.ts`.

This processing is done asynchronously using a cron job of type `PROCESS_USER_DATA`. More details can be found in `src/lib/cron/queueCron.ts`.

The first step of this feature is to create a cron job that checks whether the user has answered at least one of the form questions and has uploaded their CV. Using this data, the user's profile is created. Additionally, you need to consider edge cases (e.g., scheduling another processing if the data is updated, etc.). You can find this form at `/user/networking-settings`. Instead of scheduling the processing each time the form is submitted, it should be handled through the cron job.

Additionally, you will need to fix the endpoint responsible for uploading the CV to S3, ensuring that the correct S3 URL is stored in the database.

You will also need to implement or consult the logic to generate an object containing the user's matches. The suggested structure be as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "userName": "",
    "profilePicUrl": "",
    "whyshouldwemet": "",
    "about": ""
  }
]
```

## User Story 5

**As an event organizer, I want to ensure that users who have neither checked in nor completed their networking profile in Yiqi receive a clear message in the banner, guiding them to complete both actions so they can access AI matchmaking.**
